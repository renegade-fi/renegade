//! Defines and implements the worker that listens for on-chain events
//!
//! The event listener is responsible for:
//! - MPC Shootdown: listening for nullifier spent events and sending a
//!   shootdown event so that all future or in-flight MPCs on a given nullifier
//!   are halted
//! - Merkle path updates: As the Merkle tree is updated, wallets' Merkle paths
//!   should be updated. If these paths are allowed to stale their root reveals
//!   information about where in the contract history the wallet was last
//!   updated: potentially down to the exact transaction. So fresh Merkle paths
//!   give privacy.
